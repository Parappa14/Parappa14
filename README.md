# 👋 Hi, I’m Parappa Shiragur

Firmware & Test Automation Engineer in training • Enthusiastic about NVMe / PCIe / Networking / UEFI  
Currently in BCA (5th Semester) • Building test infrastructure & tools to verify performance, protocol compliance, and system reliability.

---

## 🔭 Currently Working On

- Automated **NVMe + PCIe validation** workflows using Python & performance tools.  
- Building test scripts / pytest suites for I/O workloads (random read/write, mixed workloads).  
- Learning UEFI (EDK II) app development & firmware boot flows.  
- Collecting logs, parsing driver / system outputs for failure diagnosis.

## ⭐ Featured Projects

| Project | Description |
|---|-------------|
| **nvme-fio-tests** | A Python-based test harness that runs fio jobs, parses performance output, and checks against thresholds (latency, IOPS). |
| **edk-hello** | Minimal UEFI “Hello, World” app using EDK II with build + QEMU run instructions. |
| **iperf-automation** | Automation of iperf3 server/client tests using pytest, subprocess; includes log parsing and reports. |
| **pci-windows-harness** | PowerShell / Windows scripts for capturing PCIe device properties, running stress I/O, gathering logs. |
| **tools / snippets** | Helpers for parsing fio/iperf output, regex extractors, utility scripts (e.g. extract driver names, logs). |
